CONSTANS is a photoperiod regulated activator of
flowering in sorghum

  Abstract
  Background: Sorghum genotypes used for grain production in temperate regions are photoperiod insensitive and
  flower early avoiding adverse environments during the reproductive phase. In contrast, energy sorghum hybrids
  are highly photoperiod sensitive with extended vegetative phases in long days, resulting in enhanced biomass
  accumulation. SbPRR37 and SbGHD7 contribute to photoperiod sensitivity in sorghum by repressing expression
  of SbEHD1 and FT-like genes, thereby delaying flowering in long days with minimal influence in short days
  (PNAS_108:16469-16474, 2011; Plant Genome_in press, 2014). The GIGANTEA (GI)-CONSTANS (CO)-FLOWERING
  LOCUS T (FT) pathway regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis and the grasses (J Exp Bot_62:2453-2463, 2011). In
  long day flowering plants, such as Arabidopsis and barley, CONSTANS activates FT expression and flowering in long
  days. In rice, a short day flowering plant, Hd1, the ortholog of CONSTANS, activates flowering in short days and
  represses flowering in long days.
  Results: Quantitative trait loci (QTL) that modify flowering time in sorghum were identified by screening Recombinant
  Inbred Lines (RILs) derived from BTx642 and Tx7000 in long days, short days, and under field conditions. Analysis of the
  flowering time QTL on SBI-10 revealed that BTx642 encodes a recessive CONSTANS allele containing a His106Tyr
  substitution in B-box 2 known to inactivate CONSTANS in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic analysis characterized sorghum
  CONSTANS as a floral activator that promotes flowering by inducing the expression of EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (SbEHD1)
  and sorghum orthologs of the maize FT genes ZCN8 (SbCN8) and ZCN12 (SbCN12). The floral repressor PSEUDORESPONSE
  REGULATOR PROTEIN 37 (PRR37) inhibits sorghum CONSTANS activity and flowering in long days.
  Conclusion: Sorghum CONSTANS is an activator of flowering that is repressed post-transcriptionally in long days by
  the floral inhibitor PRR37, contributing to photoperiod sensitive flowering in Sorghum bicolor, a short day plant.

  residues underscored by a colon indicate residues of strongly conserved properties, while residues underscored by a period indicate residues with
  more weakly similar properties. One amino acid substitution distinguishes BTx623 (SbCO-1) and Tx7000 (SbCO-2) (marked with blue arrow). Unique
